Following the ECMAScript standard, the notation `someObject.[[Prototype]]` is used to designate the prototype of someObject. Since ECMAScript 2015, the `[[Prototype]]` is accessed using the accessors `Object.getPrototypeOf()` and `Object.setPrototypeOf()`. This is equivalent to the JavaScript property `__proto__` which is non-standard but de-facto implemented by many browsers.

It should not be confused with the func.prototype property of functions, which instead specifies the `[[Prototype]]` to be assigned to all instances of objects created by the given function when used as a constructor. The `Object.prototype` property represents the Object prototype object.
